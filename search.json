Orr has 17 ball-handling errors…while only setting in half of the rotations. She split time with Anni Evans. The Big Ten setter with the second-highest number of ball handling errors is Lauren DeLo, who plays for Rutgers – she has 10. But on the other hand, she has 541 assists. That puts her ratio at one ball-handling error to every 54.1 assists. Significantly better than Orr’s.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=bigsetters, aes(x=reorder(full_name, bhe), weight=bhe)) +\n  geom_bar(data=orr, aes(x=full_name, weight=bhe), fill = \"#D00000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Big Ten setters are pretty error free...mostly\",\n    subtitle = \"All of these setters have started over 5 games and have more than 100 assists, and guess \\nwho that long red bar is.\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Ball Handling Errors\",\n    caption = \"NCAA | Paige Trutna\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s look at the Huskers’ hitting percentage when Orr is starting vs when Hames is starting. This one requires a bit of context. Orr started pretty much every game from August 26 to October 8 – and October 8 is about where you start to see the hitting percentage start to consistently be above .300. Thanks, Nicklin Hames. Another point - the Huskers started their Big Ten schedule on September 23. So, when Nicklin Hames began starting again, she wasn’t playing schools like Texas A&M Corpus Christi or Tulsa (no offense to them). She was playing schools like Penn State and Purdue.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data=bigtenmatches, aes(x=date, y=hit_pct, group=team), color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_step(data=nebraska, aes(x=date, y=hit_pct, group=team), color = \"#d00000\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Did Nebraska's hitting percentage get better when \\nNicklin Hames began starting?\",\n    subtitle = \"It looks pretty consistent, but let's think about opponents here...\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Hitting Percentage\",\n    caption = \"NCAA | Paige Trutna\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Kennedi Orr hasn’t lived up to her hype…yet. Who knows who the Huskers’ starting setter will be next year, since Hames won’t be there. Maybe it’ll be Anni Evans. Maybe Orr will make long strides and prove herself some more. Maybe a new freshman or transfer will come in and take the spots. No matter how it turns out, hopefully the Huskers will be in good hands in 2023 (literally)."
