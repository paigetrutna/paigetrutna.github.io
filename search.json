Currently, I work for Huskers athletics in the communications department. I write press releases, post on social media, work at various sporting events and more. I am also the President of the University Lutheran Chapel. There, I coordinate events, do service around the community, send out announcements, work with other leaders and handle other situations as they arise. I am also helping lead us through a transitional period between pastors."
